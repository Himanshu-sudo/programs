\chapter{Conclusion}

We have performed the container-based service state management to maximize the cloud data centerâ€™s consolidation ratio. In our proposed approach, the idle containers need to
be checkpointed to save the hardware resources. However,
after the end of the idle period, the containers need to be
resumed from the last saved state. The idle containers are
migrated to a new server if the current server does not have
sufficient resources to run it. The problem of state management
of the containers is formulated as an optimization problem that
maximizes the consolidation ratio as the objective function. We
have proposed a heuristic algorithm to solve the optimization.
In order to save the state of an idle container, we have proposed
a container checkpointing algorithm. Also, an algorithm is
proposed for the resumption of idle containers when a request
comes for these services. The evaluation in Amazon EC2
shows that the proposed algorithm is able to maximize the
consolidation ratio ensuring the state management of the containers. Thus, the proposed algorithm can efficiently manage
the service state.
